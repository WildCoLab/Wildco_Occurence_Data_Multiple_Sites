The camera showed signs of wildlife damage; we tried to remove it, but its lock was stuck. We therefore moved the damaged camera up the tree, and installed a lockbox and deployed a new camera (MK11_reset) in the original location of the damaged camera. MK11 and MK11_reset were both active from June 11, 2021, until they were visited again on October 29, 2021. On October 29, 2021, MK11 was removed.

MK11_reset therefore replaces MK11 after June 11, 2021.
